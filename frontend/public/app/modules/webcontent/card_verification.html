                <p>The Fuleex Exchange allows users to manage their currencies efficiently, and this involves both cryptocurrency and fiat money. A verified user account is allowed to make deposits and withdrawals to and from his Fuleex wallet using a payment card. Payment cards need to be confirmed prior to doing any of these transactions.</p> 
				<strong>Listed below are the steps on how a user can have his payment card verified.</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>1. Add a payment card to your account.</li>
					<li>2. Provide the necessary information needed for review, including the cardholderâ€™s name, the 16-digit card number, and its expiry date. Visa and Mastercard are preferred.</li>
					<li>3. Upload a photo of yourself holding the payment card to prove ownership. Photo should show the card information clearly, without any editing, and in JPG, PNG, or PDF format.</li>
					<li>4. Enter the 3-digit CVV/CVC number from the card. A small verification fee will be charged to your card. You may find this amount on your card statement. Enter this exact amount in the verification form to complete the process.</li>							
				</ul>
				<strong>Note: Once you have completed the form, the TC Exchange Team will review your document and will verify your payment card within 24 to 48 hours. A confirmation email will be sent to you once it has been successfully processed. Upon the receipt of this email, you will then be able to deposit or withdraw money to and from your Fuleex wallet.</strong>
