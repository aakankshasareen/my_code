              <p>Fuleex takes security seriously, and as part of its Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Policy, users are required to undergo our standard identity verification process. This protects you, the user, and Fuleex, the company, from the risks of fraud, identity theft, and other illegal activities that may potentially bring about negative repercussions to both parties.</p>
			<p>Verified users can enjoy full access to the Fuleex dashboard and the rest of its ecosystem. </p>
			<strong>We have incorporated a simple method of identity verification through our Know Your Customer (KYC) process. The steps are detailed below.</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>1. Upon registration, you will receive a confirmation email to verify your account.</li>
				<li>2. You will also be asked to complete our KYC procedure.</li>
				<li>3. As part of the KYC process, you will have to upload a clear image of any government-issued identification card. Accepted identification includes passport, national ID, and driver's license.</li>
				<li>4. Once uploaded, the Fuleex Exchange admin will review your ID and verify your identity.</li>
				<li>
				<span>5. Your ID must comply with the following:</span>
					<ul>
						<li>a. The ID must be valid due to the issue date</li>
						<li>b. The scanned image must be in colour and of high-quality JPG, PNG, or PDF formats</li>
						<li>c. All information on the identification must be readable</li>
						<li>d. Identification must not be cropped or edited in any way</li>
						<li>e. Both sides of the identification must be scanned and uploaded</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

<ul>
	<li><span>In case of unsuccessful verification, you may opt to:</span></li>
	<li>1. Re-upload a better quality image</li>
	<li>2. Use other supported ID</li>
</ul>
